# NumMoveMouse
This program use for move mouse pointer with numpad or anything else(better than window version)

this program is free and open source software (FOSS)

this repository was abandoned because I using Qt framework to make it 'work' like what I want
but it just a prototype of main part(num move mouse) not gui
